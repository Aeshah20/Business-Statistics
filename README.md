A Buffalo, New York, cola distributor is featuring a special sale on 12-packs. She wonders where in the grocery store to place the cola for maximum attention. Should it be near the front door of the grocery stores, in the cola section, at the checkout registers, or near the milk and other dairy products? Four stores with similar total sales cooperated in an experiment. In one store, the 12- packs were stacked near the front door, in another they were placed near the checkout registers, and so on. Sales were checked at specified times in each store for exactly four minutes. The results were, The Buffalo distributor wants to find out whether there is a difference in the mean
sales for cola stacked at the four locations in the store. Use the .05 significance level.




 


State the null and the alternate hypotheses.
H0=µ1=µ2=µ3=µ4
H1: At least two mean sales are not equal
Level of significance α=0.05.
What is the decision rule?
F_c=MST/MSE 
α=0.05 , 0.0 it is a right tail 
Find the ANOVA table.
ON Excel
State your decision regarding the null hypothesis.
We are accepting H0

Interpret the result.
Fc greater 3.49>P-value 0.65   ,  

Exercise 2:
A school supervisor is reviewing initial wages of former students (in $000). Samples were taken over 3 years for four different majors (accounting, administration, finance, and marketing).
For each combination of major and year, three former students were sampled.


Draw an interaction plot of year and wages means by major, what does it reveal.
They revealed values between 50-100 not more. in EXCEL 
Compute an ANOVA with statistical software (Excel) and, using the .05 significance level, test
the interaction effect of majors on wages.
The answer at Excel 
Based on your results in Question (2), conduct the appropriate tests of hypotheses for differences in factor means.
Hypothesis for Majors:
Null hypothesis: µ1=µ2=µ3
Alternative Hypothesis: At least two means differ

Hypothesis for Years:
Null hypothesis: µ1=µ2=µ3
Alternative Hypothesis: At least two means differ 

Hypothesis for Interactions:
Null hypothesis: no interaction in wages 
Alternative hypothesis: There exist an interaction in wages

Interpret the results in a brief report.
I created a table containing all the values. I went to the data analysis menu and 
chose the required and Excel created an innova table
The p-value is
P-value: 0.804188411, 7.74466E-50, 0.319743861 
Degree of freedom: the total =35
which exceeds the 0.05 significance level.
the null cannot be rejected.







Part 2
Exercise 1:
John Isaac Inc., a designer and installer of industrial signs, employs 60 people. The
company recorded the type of the most recent visit to a doctor by each employee. A
recent national survey found that 53% of all physician visits were to primary care physicians,

19% to medical specialists, 17% to surgical specialists, and 11% to emergency

departments. Test at the .01 significance level if Isaac employees differ significantly from

the survey distribution. Here are their results:



Visit Type	Number of
Visits
Primary care	30
Medical
specialist	16
Surgical
specialist	10
Emergency	4

State the null hypothesis and the alternate hypothesis.
Null hypothesis:
H0: there are no difference between observed and expected
Alternative hypothesis:
H1: there are difference between at least observed and expected 
# What is the decision rule:
Rejection rule:
If Test statistic x^2 > Critical value x_(a,k-1)^2, then reject the null hypothesis.
Determine the value of chi-square.
Use this formula:
x^2=∑(fi-ei)^2/ei
Chi-square= 2.9861
Make a decision on the null hypothesis. Interpret the result.
                 
We find the stating the hypothesis
Used formula to find Test statistic 
Critical value its equal :
k-1
=4-1
=3
Then, x_(a,k-1)^2, use it 
= 0.05,3 we go to degree of freedom 7.815
Decision : we not reject null hypothesis because x_(a,k-1)^2, 7.815 > x^2 2.986






Exercise 2:
A sample of employees at a large chemical plant was asked to indicate a preference for one of three pension plans. The results are given in the following table. Does it seem that there is a relationship between the pension plan selected and the job classification of the employees? Use the .01 significance level.

Pension
Plan
Job Class	Plan A	Plan B	Plan C
Supervisor	27	30	46
Clerical	36	97	36
Labor	98	74	39

# What is this table called?
Pension Plan
State the null hypothesis and the alternate hypothesis.
H0: They are not related 
H1: They are related 
What is the decision rule?
we reject the null hypothesis. 
Determine the value of chi-square.
chi-square = 56.3252 
Make a decision on the null hypothesis. Interpret the result.
